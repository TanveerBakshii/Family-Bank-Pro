# Family Bank Pro

Family Bank Pro is an open‑source project to help families manage finances and estate planning in one secure location. It provides a structured way to record family members, assets, liabilities and important documents (e.g., wills, deeds, insurance policies).

## Features

- **Family roster:** Add and manage family members with their relationships and contact information.
- **Asset management:** Track property, bank accounts, investments and other assets with values, ownership and notes.
- **Document vault:** Store links to digital copies of important documents like wills, property deeds, insurance policies and identification.
- **Report generation:** Produce simple summary reports of family members, assets and documents for review or export.
- **Extensible architecture:** Designed with data classes and modular functions so you can add integrations for databases, authentication and user interfaces.

## Getting Started

You can run the example script with Python 3.9+:

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TanveerBakshii/Family-Bank-Pro.git
cd Family-Bank-Pro

# install dependencies (if any are added later)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run the sample application
python app.py
```

The current version stores data in memory. To make this a production‑grade system you can extend the functions to persist data in a database, integrate authentication and build a web or mobile interface.
